# taco-read-filtering

This repository implements several simple Snakemake workflows
("hello world" style) to illustrate how to define a 
[dahak-taco](https://github.com/dahak-metagenomics/dahak-taco)
workflow.


## Setting Up Taco

Before you can run this workflow, you must first 
install `taco`. See [dahak-taco documentation](https://dahak-metagenomics.github.io/dahak-taco)
for installation instructions.

Once `taco` is installed, it will be available on the 
command line. The `taco` commands covered in this document
should be run from the main workflow repository directory.
